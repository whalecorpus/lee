## Vision
A nice site for Lee to display his work.

- background
    - color less saturated
    - gradient / some texture / not linear

    - title should be bigger
    - maybe shadow ? 
    - try title on darkened album
- about / contact buttons
    * order switch
    * font one size smaller
    - buttons?
- about / contact pages
    - whole page is a box
    - maybe background isnâ€™t white / no box

    - possibly two
- favicon
- add picture
- footer
- copy button next to email address
- fix justification
